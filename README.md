# GleesonGibson2021G3
This repository contains the code used in the Gleeson and Gibson (2021) study 'Insights into the nature of plume-ridge interaction and outflux of H2O from the Galapagos Spreading Centre'.

All code is designed for use in Python3.8.5.

Data used in the code is also provided in this repository.

This respository utilises the pymelt code of Simon Matthews and Kev Wong. Please cite https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/259243892 and https://doi.org/10.1029/2020GC009157 if you use this work.

A library called PerpleFun.py is also used in this code. This was written by the lead author and will soon be available via another repository on Matthew Gleeson's GitHub page.
